# Ashwam Language Detection

Deterministic language + script detector for short journaling snippets containing English, Hindi (Devanagari), and Hinglish.

## Labels

- primary_language: `en`, `hi`, `hinglish`, `mixed`, `unknown`  
- script: `latin`, `devanagari`, `mixed`, `other`  

Each row also has `confidence` (0–1) and an `evidence` object with ratios and lexicon hits.[file:1]

## Approach

- Script detection via Unicode ranges (Latin vs Devanagari).  
- Small Hindi-in-Latin lexicon and English word list.  
- Heuristic rules to combine script + lexicon signals into labels.  
- Confidence from script purity and fraction of recognized tokens.[file:1]
